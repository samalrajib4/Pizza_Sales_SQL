# 🍕 Pizza Sales Data Analysis using SQL

This project showcases my ability to perform business-driven data analysis using SQL. I used a fictional pizza sales dataset to extract insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, and revenue trends. The queries are organized into Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced levels.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- Total orders and revenue generated
- Popular pizza sizes and types
- Time-based sales patterns (hourly, daily)
- Category-wise revenue breakdowns
- Top-performing pizzas by revenue and quantity
- Cumulative and percentage revenue analysis

## 🧰 Tools Used

- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite — specify yours)
- DB Browser for SQLite / MySQL Workbench / pgAdmin
- VS Code (for writing queries)

## 🧾 SQL Query Breakdown

All queries are organized and saved in [`SQL_Queries/pizza_sales_analysis.sql`](SQL_Queries/pizza_sales_analysis.sql).  

They include:

- ✅ Basic Metrics (Total Orders, Revenue, Most Ordered Size)
- 📊 Intermediate Analysis (Hourly Trends, Category Orders)
- 📈 Advanced Analytics (Cumulative Revenue, Category-Wise Leaders)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Writing complex joins, CTEs, and window functions
- Performing aggregations, filtering, and time-based grouping
- Translating business questions into SQL logic

## 📎 Dataset

> A simulated pizza sales dataset commonly used in SQL case studies. 

## ✅ How to Run

1. Clone this repo  
2. Load the dataset into your SQL client  
3. Open and run queries from `SQL_Queries/pizza_sales_analysis.sql`

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Add visual dashboards using Power BI or Tableau  
- Automate report generation using Python  
- Build an interactive dashboard to monitor KPIs
